# Answering-Business-Questions-Using-SQL

In this project, I practiced using my SQL skills to answer business questions.

I used the Chinook database that was used in earlier lessons of this course. 
The Chinook database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db. 
A copy of the database schema is below.
